    <h2>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>
    <h3>SalesForce</h3>
    <p>Saas is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software, gamification, virtualization,[4] accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), Management Information Systems (MIS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), invoicing, human resource management (HRM), talent acquisition, learning management systems, content management (CM), and service desk management.

    <h2>Platform as a service (Paas)</h2>
    <h3>Cloud 9</h3>
    <p>Paas is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application; as a private service inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.</p>
